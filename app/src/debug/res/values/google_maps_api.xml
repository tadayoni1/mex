    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    09:B1:0B:77:BE:E9:53:81:47:0C:ED:5F:6F:D7:F9:0E:39:41:B0:58

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
